---

1. Install XAMPP (or another local server with PHP support).

2. Create a folder inside the htdocs directory of XAMPP (e.g.: C:\xampp\htdocs\ecologica-backend).

3. Copy the contents of the backend folder from the project into this new folder.

4. Create a .env file inside the config folder with the following content:
```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com (Se for gmail, ou smtp.office365.com se for outlook)

SMTP_USER=seuemail@gmail.com (O email que enviar√° a mensagem)

SMTP_PASS=sua_senha_de_app (A senha de app do seu email *N√£o √© sua senha de login!!!*)

SMTP_PORT=587 

SMTP_ENCRYPTION=tls

SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=seuemail@gmail.com (Email que enviar√° a mensagem)

SMTP_FROM_NAME=Nome do remetente (Para evitar span e melhor organiza√ß√£o)

RECEIVER_EMAIL=seuemail@gmail.com (o email que receber√° a mensagem)

SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com (Use smtp.office365.com if you're using Outlook)

SMTP_USER=youremail@gmail.com (The email that will send the message)

SMTP_PASS=your_app_password (Your app-specific password *Not your email login password!*)

SMTP_PORT=587 

SMTP_ENCRYPTION=tls

SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=youremail@gmail.com (The sender email)

SMTP_FROM_NAME=Sender Name (To avoid spam and for better organization)

RECEIVER_EMAIL=youremail@gmail.com (The email that will receive the message)
```
### ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING** ‚ö†Ô∏è

! If you're sharing this project, use `.gitignore` to protect the `.env` file from being tracked.

! Use an app-specific password for Gmail SMTP, and **NEVER** share your `.env` file publicly.

! Replace all placeholder values with your actual data.

! Any changes should be made inside the XAMPP folder.

5. Start Apache in XAMPP and submit the contact form.
